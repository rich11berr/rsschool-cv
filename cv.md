# So...
I'm a student, 20 y.o.
* **University** : SSTU (Saratov, Russia)
* **Institute**: Software Engineering

I started coding at about 16 years old, started with Pascal ABC, then I start studied different languages in parallel with other hobbies in University, in general I was looking for myself I think. At the university I worked with C, C#, JS, HTML, CSS, JAVA and PHP. In general, my first classic student's love was programming, and the magic when your abstract thoughts acquired a body is really mesmerizing. Eagerly grasping knowledges, I ended up settling on front-end development. 
My goal is to continue growing in IT industry, get a job  to be engaged and gain experience on real and cool projects. 

## Skills
